# GravitySimulator
Without StackOverflow I will simulate a bouncing ball. This is really just a practice run for using Github and Git.

# Results
Whilst I managed to keep the style consistent and I believe the final solution is relatively clean, I failed to use github properly. I will in future maintain one code base on one file and look to create branches and find old iterations of the project by downloading the repository instead of keeping multiple copies of the same file with different names to represent different editions.
